# Backend Operations Documentation

> **Note**: All operations documentation has been consolidated in [General Operations](../../general/operations/).

## Redirect

This directory previously contained backend-specific operations documentation. All operational procedures now apply to both frontend and backend and have been moved to the general operations section.

**Please visit**: [General Operations Documentation](../../general/operations/)
