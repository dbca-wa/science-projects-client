                Guide to using the Science Project Management System to register science projects

                Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions
                May 2024

                Background and introduction
                On 8 December 2022, the Director General advised DBCA staff of the requirement to register all science projects in the Science Project Management System (SPMS), provided by Biodiversity and Conservation Science. This directive addressed the two recommendations of a 2020 internal audit of Science Governance in DBCA that the:
                •	Executive Director Biodiversity and Conservation Science establishes a centralised database accessible to all departmental staff to capture details of all science undertaken within the department.
                •	Director General effectively communicates to divisions and statutory authorities the requirement to register science projects in a central repository. The importance and benefits (to them and the department) of a central repository, who it applies to, what is considered science, when to notify, and how to notify should be spelt out in this directive.
                The Science Project Management System (SPMS) has been expanded and modernised to provide a means of managing science projects across all business areas in DBCA and is designed such that business areas can manage projects within their areas according to their needs.  Currently, only Biodiversity and Conservation Science uses the full project management and reporting functionality of the system, although system functions can be implemented for other business areas according to the required level of functionality or as business needs change.
                It is intended that initial details of all science projects undertaken across DBCA will be captured within SPMS as soon as possible.
                This document has been prepared to assist users who are unfamiliar with SPMS, to register the initially minimal details of science projects for which they are responsible in the system. The information given below provides an abridged summary of the steps needed to:
                1.	Login to SPMS
                2.	Register and complete a user profile
                3.	Create a science project, core function, external partnership or student project
                4.	Find, view and edit science projects
                5.	Add personnel to a project team and
                6.	Edit Concept Plans, Project Plans and Progress Reports.
                Please note that a complete set of system documentation, including a detailed user guide, is in development and will be available via the system when ready.
                We are always looking for ways to improve SPMS and value your feedback! If you notice something off or would like to request a change, please submit feedback via the link at the top of the SPMS homepage, send an email to jarid.price@dbca.wa.
                gov.au or send a message on Teams. It is recommended to use Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox for the optimal SPMS browsing experience.

                1	Login
                Login to SPMS at https://scienceprojects.dbca.wa.gov.au/.
                Use your email address (including @dbca.wa.gov.au) to login when prompted, not your username.
                The first time you login, SPMS will redirect you to login.microsoftonline.com, which you already have used to login to other DBCA online services, such as SharePoint and Office 365.
                For ease of access next time, feel free to select “Keep me signed in” and allow your browser to “remember the password” (as you already are logged into your computer with the same credentials, letting the browser keep you logged in, presents no extra security risk).
                Your browser will remember your login status for a few weeks. However, for security reasons, SPMS will occasionally ask you to provide your login again.

                2	How to register and complete a user profile
                Before you register a science project, you should complete your user profile, which has already been created using your name and email address from the DBCA Single-Sign-On login that you used to access the system.
                Hover over your name/avatar in the top right of the window and select "My SPMS Profile". Click the section you wish to edit and click Update to save your changes.
                Alternatively, hover over the Users tab at the top of your screen, select Browse SPMS Users, start typing your name into the search box in the top right of the window and select your profile when it appears. Click Edit Details to update your SPMS Profile.
                To list external (non-DBCA) collaborators on your project, they too need a user profile, even though they do not need and should not be provided access to the system. This is necessary for displaying external colleagues on project overviews and reports.
                The process for registering an external user profile is to click Add new user from the Users tab at the top of your screen or click the Add user button if you are in the Browse all users page.
                Before registering a new user, please browse previously stored users (Users / Browse SPMS Users) to check whether the collaborator is already registered on the system.
                If the user is already registered, note their username and cease the registration process. The colleague can be added to the project via the process described under 4 Add personnel to a project, below.
                If the user is not registered, Add user will create a user name using the convention givennamesurname and the year of registration.
                When prompted, fill in as many details about the collaborator as required and then click the Update button at the bottom of the page.

                3	Create a science project, core function, external partnership or student project
                To register the details of a science project it must first be created in the system.
                Hover over Projects in the Navigation bar and click Create a new Project.
                Projects differ by documentation structure, approval process, and reporting requirements. Make sure you choose the correct project type as you will not be able to change this after creation. If you need to change the project type, you will need to request that the project be deleted by an administrator and create a new project of the desired type. For further guidance on project types, refer to Corporate Guideline XX Science Implementation.
                The next page lets you select which type of science project you want to create, which are defined as:
                Science Project: A discrete body of DBCA-led scientific work with a defined period of activity or an externally led science project with significant DBCA involvement.
                •	Requires approval through SPMS.
                •	Requires annual progress reporting.
                •	Requires closure form to close.
                External Partnership:
                A formal collaborative scientific partnership with an external organisation or organisations.
                •	Requires prior approval by Executive Director.
                •	Project details automatically included in annual reporting.
                •	Immediate closure without closure form.

                Core Function:
                An ongoing body of scientific work that supports biodiversity science, conservation and other business functions.
                •	Requires prior approval by Executive Director.
                •	Requires annual progress reporting.
                •	Immediate closure without closure form.
                Student Project:
                A project being undertaken by a student to attain a higher degree for which a DBCA staff member is a co-supervisor.
                •	Requires prior approval by Executive Director.
                •	Requires annual progress reporting.
                •	Immediate closure without closure form.
                Click on the appropriate Science Project/Core Function/External Partnership/Student Project button and complete the following details in the Base Information tab.
                Project title:	identifies the project and associated data; should be concise but descriptive.
                Keywords:	add some descriptive terms that will assist in searching for your project. Use return or tab to enter keywords. Comma separated strings will be stored as individual terms.
                Project Summary:	should enable users to understand what is being done.
                Upload image:	upload an informative image (JPEG files only) that will appear with your project details in SPMS and in the BCS annual report (BCS projects only). Either click on the upload box to navigate to the image or drag and drop the file.
                Click Next to move to the Details tab.
                Departmental Service:	choose to which departmental service the project contributes.
                Business Area:	which departmental business area is responsible for the project. PVS/CEM Branch, RFMS Region or BCS Program, as appropriate.
                Start and End Dates:	if unknown, enter provisional estimates and update them once confirmed.
                Project lead:	who in DBCA is responsible for project delivery (set by default to the user creating the project but can be changed at any stage).
                Data custodian:	who is responsible for data management, publishing and metadata documentation on the data catalogue (see 4 below; set by default to the user creating the project but can be changed now or later).
                Click Next to move to the Location tab
                Project Location:	enter the DBCA Region(s) or District(s), IBRA or IMCRA bioregion(s) and NRM region(s) in which the project will be undertaken.
                Click Create to register the project in SPMS.

                You will be prompted to confirm whether this is an externally led project. If you confirm that it IS externally led, a Science Project Plan will be created, otherwise a Science Concept Plan will be created.

                4	Find, view and edit Projects
                Click the Projects tab at the top of the window and select Browse all Projects.
                On the Browse Projects page you can filter projects by Active/Inactive, project kind, status, year and Business Area, and you can search for projects, using words in the project title or keywords.
                When you click on the project in the search/filter results, you will be taken to the Project Overview page. The Edit Project button under the project will allow you to edit project details, create a progress report for any previous years for which a progress report is missing and request project closure.

                5	Add personnel to a Project Team
                Once the project has been created, you can add personnel (including external collaborators) to the Project Team, if required.
                Find the project page by going to Browse Projects and searching for the project. If the person you wish to add to the Project Team has a SPMS user profile, in the Project Team section of the Project Overview page, click Invite Member and begin typing the team member’s name into the User field. Select the User, assign them a Project Role, their time allocation, short code and click Add User. If the user is not already registered follow the steps in 2 to create their user profile.
                Click on team members’ image to edit their Project Role, Time Allocation and Short Code, or to Remove from Project. If you want to make another team member the Project Lead, click that team member’s image and click the green Promote to Leader button in their profile window. NB promotion to Project Lead can only be done by the current Project Lead or Business Area Leader.

                6	Editing Concept Plans, Project Plans and Progress Reports
                Once you have navigated to the Project Overview page, click on the Concept Plan, Project Plan or Progress Report tab you want to edit. Click on the pencil icon of the section you wish to edit, which will open the system’s rich text editor, and begin editing. You can type directly into the editor or copy and paste from another open document. NB Once the Directorate has approved a Progress Report, the rich text editors will be locked and no more changes can be made.
