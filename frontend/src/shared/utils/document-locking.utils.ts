/**
 * Document locking utilities

 * Centralised logic for determining when documents, rich text fields,

 *
 * Locking rules:
 * - Any document with final approval (status === "approved") → rich text locked
 * - Concept plan → also locked if a successor project plan exists
 * - Project plan → also locked if successor progress reports exist
 * - Progress/student reports → older reports locked when a newer year exists
 * - Document approval actions → locked when the document is locked
 * - Report creation → locked when project is terminated/completed or has approved closure
